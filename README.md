# Ecommerce-Follow-Along

## Project Description

This project is a full-fledged E-Commerce Application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). It's designed to provide hands-on experience with real-world development concepts and tools, focusing on building a scalable and feature-rich online shopping platform.

## Key Features

- Built using MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)
- REST API Creation for scalable backend services
- User Authentication for secure login and registration
- Database Schema Design using MongoDB
- Robust Backend Development with Node.js and Express

## Milestone 2: Project Setup and Login Page

In this milestone, we achieved the following:

1. **Project Folder Structure**:
   - Organized project files into separate `frontend` and `backend` directories for better maintainability.

2. **React Frontend Setup**:
   - Initialized a React application for building the user interface.

3. **Node.js Backend Setup**:
   - Set up a simple Node.js server to prepare for API integration in future milestones.

4. **Tailwind CSS Configuration**:
   - Integrated and configured Tailwind CSS for modern, responsive, and utility-based styling.

5. **Login Page Development**:
   - Designed and implemented the first user interface of the application, focusing on functionality and styling.
   - The login page includes a responsive layout with Tailwind CSS and essential input fields for email and password.

6. **GitHub Repository Updates**:
   - Ensured the repository includes:
     - Separate folders for `frontend` and `backend`.
     - The functional Login Page in the `frontend` directory.

## Milestone 3: Project Setup for Backend

In this milestone, we focused on setting up the backend of the application:

1. **Backend Folder Structure**:
   - Created a structured hierarchy for organizing routes, controllers, models, and middleware.

2. **Server Setup**:
   - Initialized and configured a Node.js server using Express to handle API requests.
   - Configured the server to listen on a designated port.

3. **Database Connection**:
   - Integrated MongoDB for efficient data storage and confirmed the connection between the server and MongoDB.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Implemented basic error handling to provide clear error messages for better debugging and user feedback.

5. **GitHub Repository Updates**:
   - Updated the repository with the new backend structure and ensured all changes were committed.

## Milestone 4: User Model and File Uploads

In this milestone, we created the necessary components for user management:

1. **User Model**:
   - Designed a User Model to define how user data (like name, email, and password) is stored in the database using MongoDB schemas.

2. **User Controller**:
   - Created a User Controller to manage user data interactions, such as adding new users and retrieving user information.

3. **File Uploads with Multer**:
   - Enabled and configured Multer to allow the application to accept and store files uploaded by users, such as profile pictures.

4. **GitHub Repository Updates**:
   - Updated the repository with the new User Model and Controller, along with Multer configuration.

## Milestone 5: Sign-Up Page and Form Validation

In this milestone, we focused on the frontend user registration process:

1. **Sign-Up Page Development**:
   - Built a user-friendly Sign-Up page where users can enter their details (name, email, password) to create an account.

2. **Form Validation**:
   - Implemented form validation to ensure user inputs are correct and in the right format, preventing errors before submission.

3. **GitHub Repository Updates**:
   - Updated the repository with the new Sign-Up page and validation logic.

## Milestone 6: Password Encryption and User Data Storage

In this milestone, we enhanced security for user data:

1. **Password Encryption**:
   - Used bcrypt to hash user passwords during signup, ensuring that only encrypted passwords are stored in the database.

2. **Complete User Data Storage**:
   - Saved all user data (e.g., name, email) in the database while ensuring that passwords remain encrypted.

3. **GitHub Repository Updates**:
   - Updated the repository with the password encryption logic and complete user data storage implementation.
